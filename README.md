# Using the Instagram API
The purpose of this project was to leverage the Instagram API to return a user's pictures given the user's location context. I connected to the Instagram API using OAuth to get relevant images.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations
When I have more time, I plan on improving the overall layout of the web app. I would also like to use an additional API to extend the user experience.

## Lessons Learned:
In completing this project I learned a lot about OAuth and APIs in regards to purpose and function. built-in browser variables liked Local Storage. I also learned more about the client-server model, when reviewing concepts such as the fact that HTTP is stateless, which causes an application to reset the next time it is re-opened. As a developer, I needed to store the state of your interface somewhere. Although this is normally done on the server-side, I didn't want to force people to sign up to use the app. This is one of the main reasons I decided to leverage local storage.

## Examples:
